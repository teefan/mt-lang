# Milk Tea Self-Hosting Plan

This document tracks the plan, context, and progress for making the Milk Tea compiler self-hosting (written in Milk Tea, compiled by itself).

## Motivation

The Milk Tea compiler is currently written in Ruby. Self-hosting brings:

- The compiler becomes its own most demanding test suite — a large, real-world Milk Tea program
- Compiler performance improves (native binary vs interpreted Ruby)
- No external Ruby dependency for building Milk Tea programs (only a C compiler + committed bootstrap C)
- The language matures by confronting real systems-programming challenges

## Strategy

**Incremental stage-by-stage porting with JSON IR contracts between stages.**

Each pipeline stage is an independent program that consumes JSON from the previous stage and produces JSON for the next. A Milk Tea implementation of any stage can be verified by feeding its JSON output into the next stage of the Ruby compiler and confirming the final generated C is identical.

### Key design rules

1. **Each stage is independently developable and testable.** Stage N only needs to understand its input JSON and produce correct output JSON. It does not need the other stages to exist in Milk Tea.

2. **The JSON contracts are the single source of truth.** The schemas are derived from the Ruby compiler's existing data structures. If a schema needs to change, both sides update together.

3. **The Ruby compiler is the safety net throughout.** At every phase, any missing or broken Milk Tea stage can be substituted with the Ruby version. There is never a point where the compiler stops working.

4. **Stages are built front-to-back, with the C backend pulled forward.** Lexer → Parser → C Backend → Lowering → Semantic Analyzer. The C backend is simple (walk IR tree, print C) and unlocks self-hosting capability early.

5. **Bootstrap is always O(1).** A system C compiler + committed bootstrap C files is the only requirement to build the compiler from scratch. No chain of historical compiler versions.
